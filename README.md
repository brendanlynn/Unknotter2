# Unknotter2
Unknotter2 is the second iteration of [Unknotter](https://github.com/brendanlynn/Unknotter/), a program designed to evaluate whether or not a given knot is the unknot. Whereas the last iteration worked on notation, this iteration puts the knot in a 3D field and iterates a kernel over it.
